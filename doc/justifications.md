# The Justifications
As per the assignment specifications, I must document where and my reasoning why I implemented each 
each heavy weighing components. In particular, where and why I included inheritence, generics, and interface. 
I will update this document to be a little better fleshed out soon :)

## Inheritence
Inheritence appears multiple times throughout this program. In this markdown file I will only include the times that **I** implemented it, not the cases where it existed beforehand.
### Appearances:
- Weapon.java (Extends Item.java)
- Armour.java (Extends Item.java)
- Potion.java (Extends Item.java)

## Interfaces
Interfaces appear multiple times throughout this program. In this markdown file I will only include the times that **I** implemented it, not the cases where it existed beforehand.
### Appearances:
- Main.java (Changed class Canvas to implement MouseListener so I could add an override mouseClicked method)

## Generics
Generics appear multiple times throughout this program. In this markdown file I will only include the times that **I** implemented it, not the cases where it existed beforehand.
### Appearances:
- Grid.java (cellClicked can be passed context variables) **Not yet implemented, subject to change**
