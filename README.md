# RPGrid
RPGrid is a simple grid based RPG game developed by [Marvin Kelly](https://github.com/Suireyha) in Java for the COMP2000 unit at Macquarie University.
To view additional doccumentation for this project, including the rational, some planning, and other various documents check out the doc folder- the source code for the project can be found in the creatively named src folder.

This repository is built off of the foundation repo that was made collectively by the Macquarie University staff, along with my team for the unit including:
- [Caleb Chew](https://github.com/ChewOnThis)
- [William Milne](https://github.com/Will-Milne-MQ)
- [Tom Hannelly](https://github.com/tomhann)
- [Daniel Hardman](https://github.com/stalebiscuit)
- [Mickel](https://github.com/M1CK3L)
